//! Operator Overloading

// Operator Overloading is one of the most important feature of C++ which is a type of Polymorphism.

// Using the concept of Operator Overloading, we can overload any built-in operator i.e we can assign a new definition of existing operators.

//! Every Operator can be Overload except these below:-

// 1. Member access operator (.)
// 2. Scope resolution operator (::)
// 3. sizeof operator (sizeof)
// 4. typeid operator (typeid)
// 5. Comprehension operator (?:)
// 6. Comma operator (,)
// 7. Astric operator (*)
