//! Exception Handling

// Exceptions are some unpredictable circumstances when our program terminates suddenly with some errors/issues.

// Exception Handling provides us the facility to handle the exception. So that our program keeps running.

// These happens during running of the program.

//? Example: Trying to divide by zero.

// Exception handling is used to handle these errors gracefully.

//! C++ provides two types of exception handling:
//* 1. Try-Catch Block
//* 2. Throw-Catch Block
