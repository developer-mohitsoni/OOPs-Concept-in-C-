//! Inheritance:-
// Inheritance is a way one of the most important features of OOP. This provides us the capability to use the pre-existing code to our new project/software.

// Because it is always better to reuse the same code rather than developing all over again. This re-usability feature is incorporated by the concept of Inheritance.

//! Types of Inheritance:-

// 1. Single Inheritance:- This is the most common type of inheritance where a class inherits from only one class.

// 2. Multilevel Inheritance:- This is a type of inheritance where a class inherits from another class. This class is then inherited from another class.

// 3. Multiple Inheritance:- This is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit from multiple classes.

// 4. Hierarchical Inheritance:- This is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit from multiple classes and each class can inherit from another class.

// 5. Hybrid Inheritance:- This is a type of inheritance where a class can inherit from multiple classes and also inherit from another class.

//! Advantages of Inheritance:-
// 1. Code Reusability:- Inheritance allows us to reuse the code of the parent

// 2. Encapsulation and Modularity:- Inheritance helps to encapsulate the data and behavior of the class into a single unit.

// 3. Abstraction:- Inheritance helps to achieve abstraction by hiding the implementation details of the

// 4. Polymorphism:- Inheritance allows us to achieve polymorphism by providing different implementations of the same method.

// 5. Easier Maintenance:- Inheritance makes it easier to maintain the code as any changes.

// 6. Improved Readability:- Inheritance improves the readability of the code as it clearly shows

// 7. Reduced Code Size:- Inheritance reduces the code size as it allows us to reuse

// 8. Improved Flexibility:- Inheritance improves the flexibility of the code as it allows us

// 9. Improved Extensibility:- Inheritance improves the extensibility of the code as
